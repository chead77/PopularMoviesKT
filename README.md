# PopularMoviesKT
This application is identical to the project located at https://github.com/chead77/PopularMovies, but rewritten using Kotlin instead of Java.

Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree course project 2 (stage 1) & project 3 (stage 2)

This application displays a scrollable list of movie posters that is populated with data from a call to the TMDB API. Tapping on a poster opens a details page, where the movie can be marked as a favorite, and the user can view trailers and reviews for the movie. The main movie list can be updated via setting to sort by popularity, rating, and favorites.

Any retrofit call to the TMDB API uses a key that is stored in my local "global" gradle files. To use this project, a new
API key will need to be obtained from https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup, and the appropriate
key will need to be created in your local "global" gradle.properties file.
